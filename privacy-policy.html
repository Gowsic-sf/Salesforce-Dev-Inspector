    <h1>Privacy Policy for Salesforce Dev Inspector</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: April 20, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Salesforce Dev Inspector is a Chrome extension designed to enhance developer productivity within Salesforce Lightning by inspecting and downloading Flow metadata, viewing and editing record details, and managing user information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use the extension.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The extension does not collect or store personal data on our servers. All data processing occurs within your browser and Salesforce environment. The following data interactions occur:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: The extension accesses Salesforce session cookies (e.g., <code>sid</code>) to authenticate REST API requests. This enables fetching Flow metadata, record details, and user information (e.g., Name, Email, Alias). Cookies are read only for authentication and are not stored, shared, or used for tracking beyond your Salesforce session.</li>
        <li><strong>User Data</strong>: The extension retrieves Salesforce data via the API, including Flow metadata, record fields (e.g., Account Number, Owner), and user profiles (e.g., ID, Username, Email). This data is displayed in the inspector panel and downloaded as JSON files only upon your explicit request. No data is retained by the extension outside your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Local storage is used to save user preferences, such as the dark mode setting (<code>sf-inspector-dark-mode</code>). This contains no personally identifiable information and is limited to a boolean value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share any data with third parties. All data remains within your Salesforce instance, and downloaded files contain only the data you are authorized to access.</p>

    <h2>Downloads</h2>
    <p>The extension allows you to download Flow metadata and record data as JSON files. These downloads are initiated by you and include only Salesforce data you can view. No additional data is appended or collected.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Data is processed locally in your browser using secure Salesforce API calls. We do not have access to your data, and no encryption or transmission to external servers occurs.</p>

    <h2>User Control</h2>
    <p>
        - You control the data displayed and downloaded via the inspector panel.<br>
        - You can disable the extension or clear local storage via Chrome’s extension settings to remove saved preferences.<br>
        - The extension operates only on Salesforce domains (e.g., <code>*.salesforce.com</code>, <code>*.force.com</code>) and requires your Salesforce session for functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The extension is not intended for users under 13. It is a developer tool for Salesforce professionals.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in functionality. Updates will be posted here with a revised date. Continued use of the extension constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For questions or concerns, please contact <a href="mailto:gowsicamutha28@gmail.com">gowsicamutha28@gmail.com</a> or create an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/Gowsic-sf/Salesforce-Dev-Inspector/issues">GitHub repository</a>. If you believe we haven’t adhered to this policy, please report it to us.</p>
